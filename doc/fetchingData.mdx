# Fetching data

This section is dedicated to explain how to make requests to the server in order to fetch the data necessary to display scans.

Most of the things related to server requests are based in `flow/scans`.
There are a bunch of hooks there made to fetch data from the server.

The next sections explains and describes what each hook does.
