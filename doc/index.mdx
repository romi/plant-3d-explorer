## About the Visualizer

This is the developer documentation of the Plant Visualizer for the ROMI Project.

This app is designed to give a visual feedback of the ROMI pipeline.
It allows users to observe 3D reconstructions of plants, and to review different automatic treatments applied to these plants.

## Getting started

To get started with the visualizer, clone (or fork and then clone) the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/romi/plant-3d-explorer).

Follow the README instructions to fetch dependencies and start a local development server.

## Technologies used

The visualizer uses 3 main technologies :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)

It's strongly recommended that you learn how these 3 technologies work in order to improve the visualizer

## This documentation

This doc is aimed at documenting each *component* (again, if you don't know what a component is, read about React) of this application to help you understand the underlying architecture and inner workings of the application.
